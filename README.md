# Algorithms and Data Structures Practice

This repository contains my solutions to algorithm and data structure problems, primarily from **LeetCode**, as part of my preparation for technical interviews at MAANG (Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google). 

## Project Structure

Each problem is organized by its topic and includes a description, the solution, and analysis of the time and space complexity. The main topics are taken from the book **Cracking the Coding Interview**.

### Directory Structure
```
/arrays-and-strings
/linked-lists
/stacks-and-queues
/recursion-and-backtracking
/hash-tables
/sorting-and-searching
/trees-and-graphs
/dynamic-programming
/greedy-algorithms
/bit-manipulation
/math-and-number-theory
/advanced-topics
```

Each directory contains:
- `problem_name.py`
- `README.md` (with a description of the problem, the approach, and complexity analysis)

## Daily Problem Solving Schedule

I aim to solve at least **3 problems per day** following the schedule:
1. **Read theory** for a specific topic from *Cracking the Coding Interview*.
2. **Solve problems on LeetCode** for that topic.
3. **Commit solutions** to this repository for review by my mentor.

## Topics Covered
Here are the key topics being covered:

1. Arrays and Strings
2. Linked Lists
3. Stacks and Queues
4. Recursion and Backtracking
5. Hash Tables and Dictionaries
6. Sorting and Searching
7. Trees and Graphs
8. Dynamic Programming
9. Greedy Algorithms
10. Bit Manipulation
11. Math and Number Theory
12. Advanced Topics (Segment Trees, Tries, Suffix Arrays, etc.)
